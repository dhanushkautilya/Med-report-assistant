# 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP/NAEMSP/SCAI Guideline for the Management of Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines

## Abstract

### Methods:

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from July 2023 to April 2024.
Clinical studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and other evidence
conducted on human participants were identified that were published in English from
MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline.

### Structure:

Many recommendations from previously published guidelines have been updated with
new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by
published data.

## Preamble

### Intended Use

Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with
or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). The focus is on medical
practice in the United States, but these guidelines are relevant to patients
throughout the world. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer
decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients'
interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of
patients in most, but not all, circumstances and should not replace clinical judgment.

### Methodology and Modernization

recommendations, a brief synopsis, recommendation-specific supportive text, and, when
appropriate, flow diagrams or additional tables. Hyperlinked references are
provided for each modular knowledge chunk to facilitate quick access and review.

In recognition of the importance of cost–value considerations, in certain
guidelines, when appropriate and feasible, an assessment of value for a drug, device,
or intervention may be performed in accordance with the ACC/AHA methodology.2

To ensure that guideline recommendations remain current, new data will be
reviewed on an ongoing basis by the writing committee and staff. When applicable,
recommendations will be updated with new evidence, or new recommendations will be
created when supported by published evidence-based data. Going forward, targeted

### Selection of Writing Committee Members

The Joint Committee strives to ensure that the guideline writing committee
contains requisite content expertise and is representative of the broader
cardiovascular community by selection of experts across a spectrum of backgrounds,
representing different geographic regions, sexes, races, ethnicities, intellectual
perspectives/biases, and clinical practice settings. Organizations and professional
societies with related interests and expertise are invited to participate as
collaborators.

### Relationships With Industry and Other Entities

The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that documents are
developed without bias or improper influence. The complete policy on
relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) can be found at [https://www.acc.org/guidelines/about-guidelines-and-clinical-documents/relationships-with-industry-policy](https://www.acc.org/guidelines/about-guidelines-and-clinical-documents/relationships-with-industry-policy). Appendix 1 of the guideline lists writing committee members’ comprehensive and relevant
RWI; for the purposes of full transparency, comprehensive and relevant disclosure
information for the Joint Committee is also available at [https://www.acc.org/guidelines/about-guidelines-and-clinical-documents/guidelines-and-documents-task-forces](https://www.acc.org/guidelines/about-guidelines-and-clinical-documents/guidelines-and-documents-task-forces).

### Evidence Review and Evidence Review Committees

authoritative systematic review, feasibility of defining the benefit and risk in a time
frame consistent with the writing of a guideline, relevance to a substantial
number of patients, and likelihood that the findings can be translated into
actionable recommendations. Evidence review committee members may include methodologists,
epidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians. Recommendations developed by
the writing committee on the basis of the systematic review are marked “SR.”

### Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy

The term guideline-directed medical therapy encompasses clinical evaluation,
diagnostic testing, and both pharmacological and procedural treatments. For these
and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should confirm dosage
with product insert material and evaluate for contraindications and interactions.
Recommendations are limited to drugs, devices, and treatments approved for
clinical use in the United States.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review

cardiovascular diseases; coronary artery disease (CAD); coronary syndrome; emergency
medical services; fibrinolytic agents; hemorrhage; major adverse cardiovascular
events (MACE); morphine; myocardial infarction; non–ST-elevation myocardial
infarction (NSTEMI); percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); prehospital;
revascularization; risk; ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); time factors;
treatment outcome.

Additional relevant studies, which were published through April 2024 during the
guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and
added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The final evidence tables summarize
the evidence used by the writing committee to formulate recommendations.
References selected and published in the present document are representative and not
all-inclusive.

### 1.4. Scope of the Guideline

This guideline focuses on the management of type 1 AMI. The diagnostic
evaluation of chest pain and the management of type 2 MI, SCAD, and MINOCA are covered in
separate documents.5–8

AMI indicates acute myocardial infarction; CABG, coronary artery bypass
grafting; MI, myocardial infarction; MINOCA, MI with nonobstructive coronary artery
disease; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; and SCAD, spontaneous coronary
artery dissection.

Progressive lipid accumulation and inflammation within an atherosclerotic plaque

### 1.5. Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence

The COR indicates the strength of recommendation, encompassing the estimated
magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk. The LOE rates the quality
of scientific evidence supporting the intervention on the basis of the type,
quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other sources (Table 2).1
